# untron

This repo was used to build the smart contracts of the original, semi-optimistic design of Untron.finance. After we found SP1 zkVM and used it to design a [much more efficient coprocessing-based design](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron), we obsoleted the original architecture. This repo is archived for historical purposes.
